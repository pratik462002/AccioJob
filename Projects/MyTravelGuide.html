          <span id="inline"
            >Shaniwarwada, once the seat of the Peshwa governance in Pune is a
            286-year-old mansion and is one of the finest examples of
            architecture in the city. It is now one of the most popular tourist
            destinations in Maharashtra.</span
          ><span id="dots">...</span
          ><span id="more"
            >This grand mansion was built by the Peshwa Bajirao I himself as the
            residence of the Peshwas. Although the Wada currently covers an area
            of 625 acres, in its heyday it covered almost the entire area of the
            city itself. The place never fails to amaze the visitor with its
            various forts and fountain, and the majestic statue of Baji Rao I
            that greets the visitor at the entrance of the palace. Although most
            of the Wada was destroyed by an unexplained fire in 1828, what
            remains of it is equally thrilling and majestic. The Shaniwar Wada,
            although ridden with tales of treachery and deceit, is one of the
            last standing testimonies to the grandeur, valour, and the just rule
            of the Peshwas. The entire old part of the city of Pune is laid out
            in a chaotic yet ironically, orderly fashion all around this
            historical structure. It is around Shaniwar Wada that you will find
            the oldest markets of Pune including Laxmi Road, Tulshibaug, Ravivar
            Peth etc. It is said that on a full moon night the fort is haunted
            by the ghost of a former Peshwa king Narayanrao as he was murdered
            in the palace by his aunt and uncle - Anandi and Raghunathrao.
            However, there is not a shred of evidence to support such claims.
            So, you can get a glimpse of history and some drama as well! This
            was after all the site of the famed romance between Peshwa Bajirao
            and Mastani Sahiba. In fact, one of the gates has also been named
            after her!</span

              The Shaniwar Wada was built by Bajirao I in the 18th century.
              Bajirao served as the Peshwa or the Prime Minister to the Maratha
              ruler- Chhatrapati Sahu. The palace was at first supposed to be a
              massive 7-storey stone structure, but after the completion of the
              base floor, much hue and cry arose. The people objected to the
              construction on the grounds of the fact that stone palaces could
              be sanctioned and built only be the king and not by his Peshwa.
              Following this, it was decided that the remaining building would
              be constructed in brick, and not stone. Shaniwar Wada was finally
              completed, but little did anyone know that the monument would
              witness some murky and horrifying times in the days to come. 90
              years later, the palace was attacked by the British Artillery,
              which caused the entire six storeys to collapse and fall. Only the
              stone base remained to testify the grandeur and glory of the
              period passed. On February 27 in 1828, a great mysterious fire
              started inside the compound. The fire that raged on for seven days
              razed the entire palace to the ground and what remained were large
              granite ramparts and ruins of the buildings, along with a few
              strong teak gateways.

              The ceremonial foundation of Shaniwar Wada was laid down by Peshwa
              Baji Rao I on Saturday, January 10 in 1730. The palace was named
              Shaniwar Wada after the Marathi words Shaniwar (Saturday) and Wada
              (residential complex). The teak for the construction was imported
              from the jungles of Junnar; lime was fetched from the lime-belts
              of Jejuri and stone was brought from the quarries of Chinchwad.
              The total cost incurred in the construction at that time was INR
              16,110: a sum that was considered to be a fortune in those times.
              Several additions were made later on, such as the fortification
              walls with gates and bastions. Court-halls and other fountains and
              reservoirs were also added. The walls of the palace were painted
              with scenes from the Mahabharata and the Ramayana. Teak doorways
              were scattered all over the fort, and the beautiful marble floors
              were covered with Persian rugs. The Ganpati Rang Mahal is another
              significant site. It was the place for all religious functions of
              the Peshwas and housed a giant statue of Lord Ganesha. Currently,
              the complex comprises of the perimeter fortification wall with
              five getaways (the Dilli gate, the Mastani gate, the Khidki
              Darwaza, the Ganpati gate and the Narayan gate), nine bastion
              towers and a garden complex. A sixteen petal lotus-shaped fountain
              stands indicative of the exquisite work of those times. A few
              surviving cannons can also be found here: one at the entrance and
              one within the complex.

              This popular tourist destination in Maharashtra is as famous for
              its spookiness, and it is for its historical significance. In
              fact, Shaniwar Wada is one of the most haunted locations in the
              country. The story starts with Peshwa Narayan Rao and his
              differences with his greedy and rebellious uncle Raghunath Rao. It
              is widely believed that Raghunath Rao has sent a message to get
              hold of Narayan Rao by stating- 'Narayan Rao la dhara', which
              means 'Hold Narayan Rao'. However, before the message reached the
              guards, Raghunath Rao' s wife Anandibai changed it to 'Narayan Rao
              la mara' or 'Kill Narayan Rao'. What followed was the ghastly
              murder of the Peshwa, who cried and ran about the fort screaming
              "Kaka mala vachva", which meant "Uncle save me!" The spot where he
              was murdered is believed to be haunted by his spirit till date,
              which moves about the fort and urges his uncle to save him. People
              who live close by swear to having heard his cries on particular
              nights.
